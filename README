DESCRIPTION

Rewritten version of Cameron Cooke's curvycorners.js

	http://www.curvycorners.net

for those who have the Prototype framework

	http://www.prototypejs.org/
	
already installed.
	
REQUIREMENTS

	- prototype.js version >= 1.6.1 from http://www.prototypejs.org/

USAGE

So to make prototype-curvycorners work with any major browser simply add the
following CSS declarations and it should be good to go...

.round {
  -webkit-border-radius: 3px;
  -moz-border-radius: 3px;
}

NB at present you must (for Opera's sake) include these styles in
the page itself.

You can use an element method instead:

$('myDiv').corner( { 'tr' : 20, 'tl' : 5, 'br' : 20, 'bl' : 30 } );
